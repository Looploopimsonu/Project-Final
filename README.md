**Market Basket Analysis and Customer Segmentation in E-Commerce using Data Analytics with Distributed System**

This project focuses on market basket analysis and customer segmentation using data analytics and distributed systems. The system leverages machine learning models, sentiment analysis, and predictive analytics to analyze customer behavior, recommend products, and optimize sales strategies.

**Getting Started**
**Ensure you have the following installed:**
Python (3.8+)
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab (for analysis & model training)
Flask (for backend development)
Gradio (for UI)
Git (for version control)

**Server** 
visit and log in: www.googlecolab.com

**Installation**
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd project-name
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

**To Run the Project**:
For Data Analysis & Training: jupyter notebook or use Google Colab by uploading the notebook.
For Running the Web App: python app.py
Then, open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

**Project Working**: 

**Step-by-Step Guide**:

**Step 1**: Setup & Installation
Install Anaconda (for Jupyter Notebook) or set up Google Colab (if using cloud-based execution).
Install required libraries using pip or conda: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn keras flask gradio nltk
Install Git for version control (if needed): sudo apt install git  # Linux  brew install git  # macOS  

**Step 2**: Data Preparation & Storage
Store datasets in CSV format and upload them to Google Drive (for cloud-based execution in Colab).
Load datasets into Pandas DataFrames for processing.

**Step 3**: Data Analysis & Feature Engineering
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
Apply customer segmentation techniques using Scikit-learn (K-means, hierarchical clustering, etc.).
Perform sentiment analysis on reviews using NLTK.

**Step 4**: Model Training & Evaluation
Train predictive models using Keras (Deep Learning) and Scikit-learn (ML models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.).
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

**Step 5**: Web Application Development
Build a Flask-based backend for the web application.
Create an interactive frontend using Gradio to display insights.

**Step 6**: Deployment & Testing
Deploy the trained model using Flask API or Gradio UI.
Test the application using real-time user data and optimize performance.
